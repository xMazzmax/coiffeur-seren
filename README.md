# 💇‍♂️ Coiffeur Seren

Coiffeur Seren is a responsive landing page/single page website that I developed to practice and solidify my recently gained knowledge in HTML, CSS and web design. Other than my last project this was done for an actual client.

## 📝 First meeting preparation

> ["_People undererstimate how much smarter you can seem if you have 20 min of preparation."_ – Alex Hormozi](https://youtube.com/shorts/I4-Ya2IFz2A?si=Dzd14v-nNknZ8Wj8)

Before my first meeting with my client, I invested 20 min to find out about what's important to know before starting any website project. I did a quick YouTube search with "what to ask customer before building a website" and copied the following questions from the first search result "[Web Design Questionnaire - What to Ask Clients Before Designing a Website](https://youtu.be/xx7EGf20LQw?si=AZQLyvU7wp5JfUxU)":

1. What's your budget?
2. What's your target launch date?
3. How would you describe your organization?
4. Why is the current site no longer meeting your needs?
5. What motivates your target audience's buying decisions?
6. What makes your products and/or services unique?
7. What's your call to action?
8. How will you measure the success of the new site?
9. How will you attract visitors to the new site?
10. What features are needed for your site to be successful?
11. Do you have established branding, messaging or style guidelines?
12. What do you like/dislike about your top competitors' sites and messaging?
13. What are three of your favorite sites, and why do you like them?
14. What additional services are required?

I also invested 10 min to create a first impression about the client's company and his brand. For that I read through all his Google reviews, checked out his Instagram and Facebook and tried to have a look at his website (he didn't actually have one).

With the the total of 30 minutes of research – including my first impression about his brand – I adapted the questionaire. I removed what I didn't find useful, changed how some of them were written, reordered them to how I thought made the most sense and elaborated on the questions to help my customer with understanding them more clearly and finding an answer to them more easily:

1. What do you want exactly and why?

- I intentionally wanted to ask my client this question in broad terms to find out about **everything** he wanted and understand his reasoning/goals behind it. Without wasting anyone's time, that would help me find out right away if we were the right fit to work together and would also help with all the following questions.

2. ~~What's your budget?~~
3. Cost overview

- Instead of being paid with money, I wanted was an honest review to prove the value of my work and that I could use for future job applications and I wanted his consent to me leaving my attribution with a link to my social media page at the footer of his website. I saw that as a better long term investment than money.
  - This was my way of ensuring him it was in my best interest to deliver him results I'd be proud to share.
  - I thought the chances of me messing up since I didn't have prior practical experience as a freelancer were high. Without monetary investment I reduced the risk of my client getting mad at me if I screwed up.
  - Instead of doing some random project that besides the learning effect would potentially have no use at all, I decided to add real world value to a business.
  - I've learned from highly successful people that if you're useful to them and add tons of value without asking anything in return, the probability of them giving you tons of value back voluntarily is pretty high. I wanted to test this theory.
- Domain
  - I looked up the cheapest reliable swiss domain host: Hostpoint CHF 5 for the first year, CHF 15/year afterwards
- Website hosting
  - I chose free hosting on Netlify which provides incredible value for no money at all

3. What's your target launch date?

- If my client would take care of the content and I therefore only had to do focus on the design and coding part, I thought it would take me 1 week max. Otherwise it would take longer depending on everything he would need from me.

4. How would you describe your organization?

- Examples for a possible mission of the company:
  - "Become the first choice for hairdressing in Kriens/Lucerne."
  - "That the customer decides after the first visit to only come to us because they are so satisfied with our service."
  - "That every customer recommends us to their friends because they love our haircuts."
- Examples for possible core values of the company:
  - Customer satisfaction: The satisfaction of our customers is our top priority; we listen to their feedback and adjust our services accordingly.
  - Reliability: Our customers can rely on receiving the same high quality and service with every visit.

5. ~~Why is the current site no longer meeting your needs?~~

6. What motivates your target audience's buying decisions?

- Low price, high quality, time (e.g. fast haircuts in under 10 min, no appointments accepted and short waiting times)
- Many payment methods

7. What makes your products and/or services unique (why do your customers come to you instead to your competitors?)?

- Money back guarantee if the customer isn't happy with the result or with the speed of the service
- "We apply hair gel, hair wax etc. for free after a haircut"

8. What's your call to action (what's the objective of the website?)?

- "Stop by anytime"
- "Call us now to ensure 0 waiting time."

9. ~~How will you measure the success of the new site?~~

10. How will you attract visitors to the new site?

11. What features are needed for your site to be successful?

- E.g.
  - Photos
  - Address
  - Copy
  - Price list

12. Do you have established branding, messaging or style guidelines?

- Logo + primary color in digital form needed

13. What do you like/dislike about your top competitors' sites and messaging?

14. What are three of your favorite sites, and why do you like them?

15. What additional services are required?

- E.g. photographer, copywriter (to write the websites content/text), Google Business Account (for Google Maps), social media (Instagram, Facebook etc.), Domain

## 📅 First meeting

> [_"The greatest possible treasure to be found is where the danger is most intense"_ – Jordan B. Peterson](https://youtube.com/shorts/W_1cF7zSens?si=pgeGW8RTi3COojjT)

My initial plan was to hand out the questionnaire I'd prepare to my client as a guide on what is neecessary to successfully represent his brand and achieve his objective for the website. I wanted to leave him the content creation part so that I could focus on the design of the website and its developement with HTML and CSS only. At our initial meeting however, I quickly realized that – because of his language barrier – writing the copy on his own would be really difficult for him and most likely take a long time. Even though I wanted to develop the website as fast as possible so that I could dive deep into learning JavaScript as soon as possible, I saw a great opportunity to not just practice front-end development with this project, but also test my abilities and learn new things regarding everything that's needed for the development of a website from start to finish. I knew the result could turn out to be bad. The reason being that I didn't have any practical experience in content creation and my client didn't actively share much about his business with me like his processes and his goals – which I don't blame him for, since he'd never had to do that before – and he wanted to leave most decisions regarding the website to me. Fortunately, the nature of his business operates without much complexity and I thought I could manage the content on my own and – as mentioned above – learn a lot of useful things that would help me reach my personal long term goals. So I decided to do it all on my own.

My client wanted me to make a simple website and his only requests were the following:

- A list of his services and prices
- The shop address and contact info

I agreed with my client that the website should be as simple as possible since I believe that perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing unnecessary left to take away so that the user can achieve his goal as simple as possible as fast as possible. That doesn't mean that that's easy, in fact it's way harder than the opposite, but I believe that is is the responsibility of the engineer to take on burden of the complexity to add as much value as possible to his customers. Computers and software are simply tools and tools should make their user's life easier, not harder. While I wanted to create something great, I also wanted to do the project as efficiently as possible.

Besides the website, my client also asked me for help regarding the following:

**Google Business Account**
My client has been working at his current hairdresser shop for years. He didn't own the place initially but eventually took it over. He also took over the existing Google Business Account and instead of renaming the existing profile, he created a second profile on the same account which resulted in the Google search results displaying the name of the new and the name of the old business. I did some research and found out my client's option to solve the problem and shared it with him:

1. Delete the old profile which

   \+ Would remove the name of the old business
   \- Would also delete all his 80+ reviews with an average rating of 4.7 ★

2. Request Google to merge the old profile to the new one

   \+ Would move over all reviews to the new profile
   \- Request could take up to two weeks and still be rejected

My client didn't mind choosing the first option. He told be he could get new reviews fast. I told him the decision is up to him, but if I was in his shoes, I'd choose the second option first because he had nothing to lose with that. If Google accepted the request he would get to keep all his great reviews which we could use as social proof of his service on his website. If he waited two weeks and his request was rejected, he could still delete the old profile. He liked my suggestion and we went with it. I also updated his opening hours, cover picture, logo and

**Apple Business Account**
During the project I came to the realization that Apple users don't use Google Maps, they use Apple Maps instead. I informed my client about it, created him an Apple Business Account, did everything necessary to claim his existing shop on Apple Maps and updated everything like on Google Maps by the end of the project.

**Instagram QR code**
My client wanted me to make him a QR code of a link to his Instagram. He agreed to my suggestion of additionally creating one with a direct link for people to leave a review on Google and printing both on self-adhesive paper so he could easily stick it wherever he wanted. I ordered the paper on Amazon, searched for inspiration on Google, selected a few ideas I liked and created a few samples of which my customer could chose from. I personalized/edited the two chosen options with the free web based photoshop tool [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), generated the QR codes on [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) and brought everything together. By the end of the project I also got the idea of doing the same for the website so what my client could stick it on his entrance door and enable curious passersby to explore and close (say yes to) the services of my client entirely on their own – effectively making the sale themselves without any effort from my client. Here are the results:

### 🏗️ Website layout

> _"Don't reinvent the wheel, just realign it."_ – Anthony D'Angelo

As I did for the questionaire, I did for the website of my customer aswell. Instead of building some random website layout, I copied from the best. For that I searched "best landing page" on YouTube and followed the instructions from the video [Why is THIS the PERFECT Landing Page?](https://youtu.be/UC9pTtrhFys?si=cNwzowfQ-rYf-yz3) to maximize the conversion rate of potential customers that visit the website.
