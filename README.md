# 💇‍♂️ Coiffeur Seren

Coiffeur Seren is a responsive landing page/single page website that I developed to practice and solidify my recently gained knowledge in HTML, CSS and web design. Other than my last project this was done for an actual client.

## 📝 First Meeting Preparation

> ["_People undererstimate how much smarter you can seem if you have 20 min of preparation."_ – Alex Hormozi](https://youtube.com/shorts/I4-Ya2IFz2A?si=Dzd14v-nNknZ8Wj8)

Before my first meeting with my client, I invested 20 min to find out about what's important to know before starting any website project. I did a quick YouTube search with "what to ask customer before building a website" and copied the following questions from the first search result "[Web Design Questionnaire - What to Ask Clients Before Designing a Website](https://youtu.be/xx7EGf20LQw?si=AZQLyvU7wp5JfUxU)". If you don't intend on copying the questions, skip them, as I'm gonna dive into them further down below.

1. What's your budget?
2. What's your target launch date?
3. How would you describe your organization?
4. Why is the current site no longer meeting your needs?
5. What motivates your target audience's buying decisions?
6. What makes your products and/or services unique?
7. What's your call to action?
8. How will you measure the success of the new site?
9. How will you attract visitors to the new site?
10. What features are needed for your site to be successful?
11. Do you have established branding, messaging or style guidelines?
12. What do you like/dislike about your top competitors' sites and messaging?
13. What are three of your favorite sites, and why do you like them?
14. What additional services are required?

I also invested 10 min to create a first impression about the client's company and his brand. For that I read through all his Google reviews, checked out his Instagram and Facebook and tried to have a look at his website (he didn't actually have one).

With the the total of 30 minutes of research – including my first impression about his brand – I adapted the questionaire. I removed what I didn't find useful, changed how some of them were written, reordered them to how I thought made the most sense and elaborated on the questions to help my customer with understanding them more clearly and finding an answer to them more easily:

**1. What do you want exactly and why?**

- I intentionally wanted to ask my client this question in broad terms to find out about **everything** he wanted and understand his reasoning/goals behind it. Without wasting anyone's time, that would help me find out right away if we were the right fit to work together and would also help with all the following questions.

2. ~~What's your budget?~~
   **2. Cost overview**

- Instead of being paid with money, I wanted was an honest review to prove the value of my work and that I could use for future job applications and I wanted his consent to me leaving my attribution with a link to my social media page at the footer of his website. I saw that as a better long term investment than money.
  - This was my way of ensuring him it was in my best interest to deliver him results I'd be proud to share.
  - I thought the chances of me messing up since I didn't have prior practical experience as a freelancer were high. Without monetary investment I reduced the risk of my client getting mad at me if I screwed up.
  - Instead of doing some random project that besides the learning effect would potentially have no use at all, I decided to add real world value to a business.
  - I've learned from highly successful people that if you're useful to them and add tons of value without asking anything in return, the probability of them giving you tons of value back voluntarily is pretty high. I wanted to test this theory.
- Domain
  - I looked up the cheapest reliable swiss domain host: Hostpoint CHF 5 for the first year, CHF 15/year afterwards
- Website hosting
  - I chose free hosting on Netlify which provides incredible value for no money at all

**3. What's your target launch date?**

- If my client would take care of the content and I therefore only had to do focus on the design and coding part, I thought it would take me 1 week max. Otherwise it would take longer depending on everything he would need from me.

**4. How would you describe your organization?**

- Examples for a possible mission of the company:
  - "Become the first choice for hairdressing in Kriens/Lucerne."
  - "That the customer decides after the first visit to only come to us because they are so satisfied with our service."
  - "That every customer recommends us to their friends because they love our haircuts."
- Examples for possible core values of the company:
  - Customer satisfaction: The satisfaction of our customers is our top priority; we listen to their feedback and adjust our services accordingly.
  - Reliability: Our customers can rely on receiving the same high quality and service with every visit.

**5. ~~Why is the current site no longer meeting your needs?~~**

**6. What motivates your target audience's buying decisions?**

- Low price, high quality, time (e.g. fast haircuts in under 10 min, no appointments accepted and short waiting times)
- Many payment methods

**7. What makes your products and/or services unique (why do your customers come to you instead to your competitors?)?**

- Money back guarantee if the customer isn't happy with the result or with the speed of the service
- "We apply hair gel, hair wax etc. for free after a haircut"

**8. What's your call to action (what's the objective of the website?)?**

- "Stop by anytime"
- "Call us now to ensure 0 waiting time."

**9. ~~How will you measure the success of the new site?~~**

**10. How will you attract visitors to the new site?**

**11. What features are needed for your site to be successful?**

- E.g.
  - Photos
  - Address
  - Copy
  - Price list

**12. Do you have established branding, messaging or style guidelines?**

- Logo + primary color in digital form needed

**13. What do you like/dislike about your top competitors' sites and messaging?**

**14. What are three of your favorite sites, and why do you like them?**

**15. What additional services are required?**

- E.g. photographer, copywriter (to write the websites content/text), Google Business Account (for Google Maps), social media (Instagram, Facebook etc.), Domain

## 📅 First Meeting

> [_"The greatest possible treasure to be found is where the danger is most intense"_ – Jordan B. Peterson](https://youtube.com/shorts/W_1cF7zSens?si=pgeGW8RTi3COojjT)

My initial plan was to hand out the questionnaire I'd prepare to my client as a guide on what is neecessary to successfully represent his brand and achieve his objective for the website. I wanted to leave him the content creation part so that I could focus on the design of the website and its developement with HTML and CSS only. At our initial meeting however, I quickly realized that – because of his language barrier – writing the copy on his own would be really difficult for him and most likely take a long time. Even though I wanted to develop the website as fast as possible so that I could dive deep into learning JavaScript as soon as possible, I saw a great opportunity to not just practice front-end development with this project, but also test my abilities and learn new things regarding everything that's needed for the development of a website from start to finish. I knew the result could turn out to be bad. The reason being that I didn't have any practical experience in content creation and my client didn't actively share much about his business with me like his processes and his goals – which I don't blame him for, since he'd never had to do that before – and he wanted to leave most decisions regarding the website to me. Fortunately, the nature of his business operates without much complexity and I thought I could manage the content on my own. As you're soon going to find out, my client wanted my help with more than just that. My goal was to overdeliver and exceed his expectations and as mentioned above to learn a lot of useful things that might help me reach my personal long term goals. So I decided to do it all on my own.

During our meeting I went over the questionaire I'd prepared and only asked him about the most essential questions:

**1. What do you want exactly and why?**

- A simple website.
- To fix his Google Business Profile.
- A QR Code with a link to his Business's Instagram.

**2. Cost overview**

- I explained what I wanted as payment as mentioned in the previous section (except for the part about me testing him to give me value back volontarily), but my client insisted on paying money on top of that. I declined firmly but respectfully and he eventually agreed to my payment terms.
- Domain
  - Instead of using the name of his shop as the domain name "seren-barbershop.ch" I suggested him to choose "coiffeur-seren.ch" for better search engine optimization, which he agreed to.
  - He also agreed on the price
- Website hosting
  - I told him I only ever sell someone what they truly need, nothing more. And because of that, I'd use the free hosting option from Netlify. He loved that.

**3. What's your target launch date?**

- He wasn't in a rush and asked me how long I needed. I told him I thought I could do it in 2 weeks and he said that's fine.

**4. What motivates your target audience's buying decisions?**

- I only asked him about his services and prices and made a picture of the price list he showed me.

**5. What makes your products and/or services unique (why do your customers come to you instead to your competitors?)?**

- 2 free parking lots for customers
- Toilet on-site
- Cash and Twint as payment option

**6. What features are needed for your site to be successful?**

- A list of his services and prices.
- The shop address and contact info.

**7. Do you have established branding, messaging or style guidelines?**

- He didn't have the logo in digital form that I needed and told me I should improvise. I took a photo of his logo and wanted to simply choose a color that comes as close to it as possible.

**8. What additional services are required?**

- Copywriting.
- Photography (We agreed that he would provide me with photos for a gallery).
- He gave me his Google account login details for me to fix the issues of his Google Business Profile.

I agreed with my client's decision that the website should be as simple as possible. My definition of greatness is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing unnecessary left to take away from a product or service so that the user can achieve his goals as simple as possible and as fast as possible. Adding more value with less stuff isn't easy, in fact it's way harder. My philosophy is that it's the responsibility of the service provider to take on the burden of that complexity in order to add as much value as possible to his customers. In regards to software, I think that to the users, software are primarily tools and tools should make their life easier, not harder. That's the approach I personally take and the goal I aim towards when providing any kind of service or product, not just software development.

### 🌍 Beyond Website Developent - Marketing Strategies and Execution

Besides the website, my client also asked me for help regarding the following:

**Google Business Account**
My client has been working at his current hairdresser shop for years. He didn't own the place initially but eventually took it over. He also took over the existing Google Business Account and instead of renaming the existing profile, he created a second profile on the same account which resulted in the Google search results displaying the name of the new and the name of the old business. I did some research and found out my client's option to solve the problem and shared it with him:

1. Delete the old profile which ...  
   \+ ... would remove the name of the old business.  
   \- ... would also delete all his 80+ reviews with an average rating of 4.7 ★.

2. Request Google to merge the old profile into the new one ...  
   \+ ... would move over all existing reviews to the new profile.  
   \- ... request could take up to two weeks and still be rejected.

My client wanted to choose the first option as he thought he could get new reviews fast. I told him the decision is up to him, but if I was in his shoes, I'd choose the second option first because he had nothing to lose and everything to win with it. If Google accepted the request he would get to keep all his great reviews which we could use on the website as social proof of how great his service is. If he waited two weeks and his request was rejected, he could still delete the old profile. He liked my suggestion chose that path. I also updated his opening hours, cover picture, logo and also the website address once it went live.

**Apple Business Account**
During the project I came to the realization that Apple users don't use Google Maps, they use Apple Maps instead. I informed my client about it, created him an Apple Business Account, did everything necessary to claim his existing shop on Apple Maps and updated everything like on Google Maps by the end of the project.

**Instagram QR code**
My client wanted me to make him a QR code of a link to his Instagram. He agreed to my suggestion of additionally creating one with a direct link for people to leave a review on Google and printing both on self-adhesive paper so he could easily stick it wherever he wanted. I ordered the paper on Amazon, searched for inspiration on Google, selected a few ideas I liked and created a few samples of which my customer could chose from. I personalized/edited the two chosen options with the free web based photoshop tool [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), generated the QR codes on [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) and brought everything together. By the end of the project I also got the idea of doing the same for the website so that my client could stick it on his entrance door and enable curious passersby to explore and close (say yes to) the services of my client entirely on their own – effectively making the sale themselves without any effort from my client. Here are the results:

## 🧱 Website layout

> _"Don't reinvent the wheel, just realign it."_ – Anthony D'Angelo

While I wanted to create something great, I also wanted to do the project as efficiently as possible. Just as I approached the questionnaire, I applied the same principle to my customer's website. Rather than trying to come up with a layout myself, I drew inspiration from the best ones that already exists. For that I searched "best landing page" on YouTube and followed the instructions from the video [Why is THIS the PERFECT Landing Page?](https://youtu.be/UC9pTtrhFys?si=cNwzowfQ-rYf-yz3) to maximize the conversion rate of potential customers that visit the website. Here are the key takeaways from the video:

- Don't offer your service or your product, offer the dream outcome your customer is looking for.
- Create trust by providing undeniable proof that your service or product leads to the dream outcome of your customer.
- Point the user toward one – and only one – simple and clear action he needs to take to reach his desired result.

In addition to the last video mentioned, I also watched the video [Copy This Perfect Landing Page To Double Your Leads Instantly](https://youtu.be/V2_LNtV95jM?si=k1_9B_N1mqqtbFJm&t=827) from the same channel and in one minute it explains the connection between how people make buying decisions:

- 95% of a customer's buying decision is based on emotions e.g. desires, dreams etc.
- Emotions change all the time but proof is timeless and validates decisions and claims. To make sure the customer doesn't regret his decision when his emotions change and to cover the missing 5% of a customer's buying decision, the emotional decision needs to be backed up with logic on how the service or product ensures the claimed results e.g. stats, social proof, visual proof, features etc.

With the blueprint gathered as a starting point, here's the layout I decided to implement in the exact order I planned to display it on the website:

**- Navbar (enhances user experience)**

- While the blueprint I used told me to leave out the nav to lead force the user to take the optimal path to the CTA (Call To Action), I didn't want to take control away from the user and reduce his user experience, as that's something I myself would hate. So I decided to implement it.
- Includes from left to right:
  - Logo (with a hyperlink to he top of the homepage).
  - Descriptive single word for each section (except the CTA).
  - Highlighted CTA to the correspondent section.

**- Hero (emotinally and logically grabs user's attention)**

- Left half from top to bottom:
  - Heading: Emotion based promise of an outcome.
  - Subheading: Logic based explanation on how to achieve it.
  - CTA (Call to action): Action the user needs to take to directly achieve the desired result. It's written as clearly and with as few words as possible.
  - CTA alternative: Second option the user can take if he isn't convinced by the hero section and needs more proof. It leads the user to the following section.
  - Google reviews rating: Displays the average Google reviews rating and the amount of reviews it's based on to add social proof and create trust.

**- Benefits (emotional proof)**

- Heading: Doesn't just describe what the section is about but conveys what value it adds to the user.
- 3 (magic number) benefits (results instead of things) the service provides to the user with the following layout for each benefit component:
  - Descriptive icon.
    - A picture is worth a thousand words.
    - Visuals help us understand ideas about 6x better than just text alone.
  - Heading: (Emotional) result of the benefit described in 1-3 words.
  - Subheading: (Logical) proof on how the benefit is achieved/the explanation of the thing or feature you provide to make it possible described in 1-3 short sentences.

**- Features (logical proof)**

- Heading: See "Benefits".
- Simply list **all** features you provide with your services so that the user has overwhelming (logical) proof to accept your offer. Add an icon like a checkmark to each feature instead of just bullet points to make it more visually appealing. Only add a short description to a feature if strictly necessary for the user to understand what the feature is about, but before doing that, try fixing it by rephrasing the feature itself.

**- Reviews (social proof)**

- If you don't have reviews, you could also display logos of businesses you've helped with your product or service instead.
- Ask your customers to give you a review. [The best time to ask for that is at the moment of greatest satisfaction](https://youtube.com/shorts/B0VXkSmBrbQ?si=rnae2OBG8MG5mlUg), right after delivering them their dream outcome with your product or service. You may already have great reviews but might not be aware of it. Here are some places you should consider looking for it:
  - Google Maps and Apple Maps.
  - Comments on your social media:
    - Instagram.
    - Facebook.
    - LinkedIn.
  - Email.
- Choose the 3 (magic number) best reviews you have based on these things ordered from highest to lowest priority:
  - It mentions at least one of the following:
    - How your offer helped reach a specific goal with the best result possible e.g. "$1'000 investment and 100'000 profit" or "80% time/money saved in X with the help of the service".
    - It proves a benefit of using what you offer.
    - Talks about how the user overcame a common objection so that the customer can relate to his personal fears and you grab his attention e.g. "At first I thought it was pretty expensive, but the amount of money and time I saved as a result of this investment, made it all worth it!"
  - Has a photo of the customer.
  - Has the name of the customer.
  - Best rating
  - Proof is from recent times as it's more compelling than old proof (5 days vs 5 years old proof)
- Layout from top to bottom for each of the reviews:
  - Heading: See "Benefits".
  - 5 stars icons: Visually displays the best rating possible even when the user skims through the page and doesn't take the time to read the reviews.
  - Review text: 1-2 very short straight to the point sentences of just text passages of a review to increase the likelihood that users actually read the text.
  - Image of the author: This makes the review appear more authentic.
  - Name of the author: This also makes it appear more authentic.

**- Gallery (visual proof)**

- Visual proof is the best there is.
  - Here's a list of visual media types starting with the most convincing:
    - Video + audio
    - Video
    - Photo or Screenshot (real image)
    - Illustration (image created by an artist or AI)
  - If possible use before and after comparisons
- I went with photos of the results from my clients services

**- Offer (logical proof)**

- Have you ever spent what felt like an eternity to try and find a movie or serie on Netflix, only to not find nothing at all and decide to do something else? That's known as analysis paralysis. It's the feeling of being unable to make a decision due to overthinking a problem and often happens when a person's dealing with too many variables/options. Netflix mitigated this problem with providing you with different top 10 lists that are based on things like your location, viewing history and other members with similar taste. If you want your user to take you up on any offer at all, don't overwhelm him with too many options. Generally speaking, the optimal number is – you guessed it – 3 options. But this number may vary between industries and existing services. Just make sure your offer is a conveyed as simple as possible with as few words as possible while still maintaining the essential impactful information needed.
- For my client I sought inspiration from different hairdresser websites but the only designs I liked were those I found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) which is a self-promotion platform for the digital designers.

**- FAQ (emotional fears)**

- The frequently asked questions section resolves common questions users might have about your product or service and most important their personal fears that are based on past bad experiences and misconceptions. Here's some pressure points:
  - Money
  - Time
  - Trust
- Choose 5-6 questions and provide an answer to them, preferrably with some proof.
- Layout:
  - Heading: Question
  - Paragraph: Answer. Since this taps into the customer's fears – which is the strongest form of motivation –, you can get away with writing longer text than the rest of the content on the website, but should still try to be concise and precise.

**- CTA (goal of the whole website)**

- The primary purpose of the website is to encourage the user to act upon the call to action, so that you can help him solve whatever problem or reach whatever goal he has. Therefore, one should take as much time as needed to make all the effort put into the development of the website worthwhile. Start the development of the website thinking about and writing the CTA and after finishing writing all the content, revisit it and try to rewrite it such that it's more concise and can be understood more clearly by the user.
- Layout:
  - Heading: Same as in the hero section.
  - Paragraph: Elaborate on the heading and the subheading of the hero.
  - Button: Direct call to action that describes what's going to happen when the user presses the button.
    \- **Bad** example: Call us now! //The user doesn't know why to call.  
    \+ **Good** example: Call now and book a consultation! //Describes exactly what's going to happen and why.
