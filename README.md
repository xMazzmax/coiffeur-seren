# Coiffeur Seren

Coiffeur Seren is a responsive landing page/single page website that was developed by me to practice and solidify my recently gained knowledge in HTML, CSS and design. Other than my last project this was done for an actual client.

## Note

My initial plan was to leave content creation to my client and just focus on the developement of the website with HTML and CSS. I prepared a written questionnaire to at least help him with some guidance on what info is needed to successfully represent his brand and objective for the website. At our initial meeting I quickly realized that the language barrier would make it really hard for him to do content creation on his own and I saw this as a great opportunity to not just practive front-end development but test my abilities and learn about everything what's needed for the development and deployment of a website from start to finish. So I did it all and I'm happy with the result as well as my customer.
