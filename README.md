# 💇‍♂️ Coiffeur Seren

Coiffeur Seren is a responsive landing page/single page website that I developed to practice and solidify my recently gained knowledge in HTML, CSS and web design. Other than my last project this was done for an actual client.

## 📄 Note

My initial plan was to leave content creation to my client and just focus on the developement of the website with HTML and CSS. I prepared a written questionnaire to at least give my client some guidance on what info is neecessary to successfully represent his brand and achieve the objective with the website. At our initial meeting however, I quickly realized that, because of his language barrier, writing the copy on his own would really hard for him and probably take a long time. I wanted to challenge myself and develop the website as fast as possible and I saw a great opportunity to not just practive front-end development but also test my abilities and learn new things about everything that's needed for the development of a website from start to finish. So I decided to do it all on my own. Here's how I did it:

### ❓ Customer questionaire

> "_Don't reinvent the wheel, just realign it."_ – Anthony D'Angelo's

To start the whole project I did a YouTube search with "what to ask customer before building a website", copied all the questions from the first search result "[Web Design Questionnaire - What to Ask Clients Before Designing a Website](https://youtu.be/xx7EGf20LQw?si=AZQLyvU7wp5JfUxU)" and adapted them how I saw fit including their order.

1. What do you want exactly and why?

- I intentionally asked him this question in broad terms to find out **everything** he wanted and understand his reasoning/goals behind it.

2. Cost

- I didn't want to be paid with money, all I wanted was an honest review to prove the value of my work and that I could use for future job applications.
  - This was my way of ensuring him it was in my best interest to deliver him results I'd be proud to share.
  - I thought the chances of me messing up since I didn't have prior practical experience as a freelancer were high. Without monetary investment I reduced the risk of my client getting mad at me if I screwed up.
  - Instead of doing some random project that besides the learning effect would potentially have no use at all, I decided to add real world value to a business.
  - I've learned from highly successful people that if you're useful to them and add tons of value without asking anything in return, the probability of them giving you tons of value back voluntarily is pretty high. I wanted to test this theory.
