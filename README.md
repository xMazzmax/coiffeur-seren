## 📅 Client Meetings

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

> ["_People undererstimate how much smarter you can seem if you have 20 min of preparation."_ – Alex Hormozi](https://youtube.com/shorts/I4-Ya2IFz2A?si=Dzd14v-nNknZ8Wj8)

Before my first meeting with my client, I invested 20 min to find out about what's important to know before starting any website project. I did a quick YouTube search with "what to ask a customer before building a website" and copied the following questions from the first search result "[Web Design Questionnaire - What to Ask Clients Before Designing a Website](https://youtu.be/xx7EGf20LQw?si=AZQLyvU7wp5JfUxU)". If you don't intend on copying the questions, skip them, as I'm gonna dive into them further down below.

1. What's your budget?
2. What's your target launch date?
3. How would you describe your organization?
4. Why is the current site no longer meeting your needs?
5. What motivates your target audience's buying decisions?
6. What makes your products and/or services unique?
7. What's your call to action?
8. How will you measure the success of the new site?
9. How will you attract visitors to the new site?
10. What features are needed for your site to be successful?
11. Do you have established branding, messaging or style guidelines?
12. What do you like/dislike about your top competitors' sites and messaging?
13. What are three of your favorite sites, and why do you like them?
14. What additional services are required?

I also invested 10 min to create a first impression about the client's company and his brand. For that I read through all his Google reviews, checked out his Instagram and Facebook and tried to have a look at his website (he didn't actually have one).

With the the total of 30 minutes of research – including my first impression about his brand – I adapted the questionnaire. I removed what I didn't find useful, changed how some of them were written, reordered them to how I thought made the most sense and elaborated on the questions to help my customer with understanding them more clearly and finding an answer to them more easily:

**1. What do you want exactly and why?**

- I intentionally wanted to ask my client this question in broad terms to find out about **everything** he wanted and understand his reasoning/goals behind it. Without wasting anyone's time, that would help me find out right away if we were the right fit to work together and would also help with all the following questions.

**2. ~~What's your budget?~~**  
**2. Cost overview**

- Instead of being paid with money, I wanted was an honest review to prove the value of my work and that I could use for future job applications and I wanted his consent to me leaving my attribution with a link to my social media page at the footer of his website. I saw that as a better long term investment than money.
  - This was my way of ensuring him it was in my best interest to deliver him results I'd be proud to share.
  - I thought the chances of me messing up since I didn't have prior practical experience as a freelancer were high. Without monetary investment I reduced the risk of my client getting mad at me if I screwed up.
  - Instead of doing some random project that besides the learning effect would potentially have no use at all, I decided to add real world value to a business.
  - I've learned from highly successful people that if you're useful to them and add tons of value without asking anything in return, the probability of them giving you tons of value back voluntarily is pretty high. I wanted to test this theory.
- Domain
  - I looked up the cheapest reliable swiss domain host: [Hostpoint](https://www.hostpoint.ch/en/domains/domains.html) CHF 5 for the first year, CHF 15/year afterwards
- Website hosting
  - I chose [free hosting on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) which provides incredible value for no money at all

**3. What's your target launch date?**

- If my client would take care of the content and I therefore only had to do focus on the design and coding part, I thought it would take me 1 week max. Otherwise it would take longer depending on the things he would need from me.

**4. How would you describe your organization?**

- Examples for a possible mission of the company:
  - "Become the first choice for hairdressing in Kriens/Lucerne."
  - "That the customer decides after the first visit to only come to us because they are so satisfied with our service."
  - "That every customer recommends us to their friends because they love our haircuts."
- Examples for possible core values of the company:
  - Customer satisfaction: The satisfaction of our customers is our top priority; we listen to their feedback and adjust our services accordingly.
  - Reliability: Our customers can rely on receiving the same high quality and service with every visit.

**5. ~~Why is the current site no longer meeting your needs?~~**

**6. What motivates your target audience's buying decisions?**

- Low price, high quality, time (e.g. fast haircuts in under 10 min, no appointments accepted and short waiting times)
- Many payment methods

**7. What makes your products and/or services unique (why do your customers come to you instead to your competitors)?**

- Money back guarantee if the customer isn't happy with the result or with the speed of the service
- "We apply hair gel, hair wax etc. for free after a haircut"

**8. What's your call to action (what's the objective of the website)?**

- "Stop by anytime"
- "Call us now to ensure 0 waiting time."

**9. ~~How will you measure the success of the new site?~~**

**10. How will you attract visitors to the new site?**

**11. What features are needed for your site to be successful?**

- E.g.
  - Photos
  - Address
  - Copy
  - Price list

**12. Do you have established branding, messaging or style guidelines?**

- Logo + primary color in digital form needed

**13. What do you like/dislike about your top competitors' sites and messaging?**

**14. What are three of your favorite sites, and why do you like them?**

**15. What additional services are required?**

- E.g. photographer, copywriter (to write the websites content/text), Google Business Account (for Google Maps), social media (Instagram, Facebook etc.), Domain

> [_"The greatest possible treasure to be found is where the danger is most intense"_ – Jordan B. Peterson](https://youtube.com/shorts/W_1cF7zSens?si=pgeGW8RTi3COojjT)

My original plan was to hand out the prepared questionnaire to my client as a guide on what is neecessary to successfully represent his brand and achieve his objective for the website. I wanted to leave him the content creation part so that I could focus on the design of the website and its developement with HTML and CSS only. At our first meeting however, I quickly realized that – because of his language barrier – writing the copy on his own would be really difficult for him and most likely take a long time. Even though I wanted to develop the website as fast as possible so that I could dive deep into learning JavaScript as soon as possible, I saw a great opportunity to not just practice front-end development with this project, but also test my abilities and learn new things regarding everything that's needed for the development of a website from start to finish. I knew the result could turn out to be bad. The reason being that I didn't have any practical experience in content creation and my client didn't actively share much about his business with me like his processes and his goals – which I don't blame him for, since he'd never had to do that before – and he wanted to leave most decisions regarding the website to me. Fortunately, the nature of his business operates without much complexity and I thought I could manage the content on my own. As you're soon going to find out, my client wanted my help with more than just that. My goal was to overdeliver and exceed his expectations and as mentioned above to learn a lot of useful things that might help me reach my personal long term goals. So I decided to do it all on my own.

During our meeting I went through the questionnaire with him but after getting the feeling that he didn't want to dive deep into the questions, I decided to only ask him about essential questions that I thought he could give me an answer to:

**1. What do you want exactly and why?**

- A simple website.
- To fix his Google Business Profile.
- A QR Code with a link to his Business's Instagram.

**2. Cost overview**

- I explained what I wanted as payment as mentioned in the previous section (except for the part about me testing him to give me value back volontarily), but my client insisted on paying money on top of that. I declined firmly but respectfully and he eventually agreed to my payment terms.
- Domain
  - Instead of using the name of his shop as the domain name "seren-barbershop.ch" I suggested him to choose "coiffeur-seren.ch" for better search engine optimization, which he agreed to.
  - He also agreed on the price
- Website hosting
  - I told him I only ever sell someone what they truly need, nothing more. And because of that, I'd use the free hosting option from Netlify. He loved that.

**3. What's your target launch date?**

- He wasn't in a rush and asked me how long I needed. I told him I thought I could do it in 2 weeks and he said that's fine.

**4. What motivates your target audience's buying decisions?**

- I only asked him about his services and prices and made a picture of the price list he showed me.

**5. What makes your products and/or services unique (why do your customers come to you instead to your competitors)?**

- 2 free parking lots for customers
- Toilet on-site
- Cash and Twint as payment option

**6. What features are needed for your site to be successful?**

- A list of his services and prices.
- The shop address and contact info.

**7. Do you have established branding, messaging or style guidelines?**

- He didn't have the logo in digital form and gave me the impression that he didn't want to bother contacting the people that designed and printed the logo he had on his window. He told me I should improvise. I took a photo of his logo and wanted to simply choose a color that comes as close to it as possible.

**8. What additional services are required?**

- Copywriting.
- Photography (we agreed that he would provide me with photos for a gallery).
- He gave me his Google account login details for me to fix the issues of his Google Business Profile.

I agreed with my client's decision that the website should be as simple as possible. My definition of greatness is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing unnecessary left to take away from a product or service so that the user can achieve his goals as simple as possible and as fast as possible. Adding more value with less stuff isn't easy, in fact it's way harder. My philosophy is that it's the responsibility of the service provider to take on the burden of that complexity in order to add as much value as possible to his customers. In regards to software, I think that to the users, software are primarily tools and tools should make their life easier, not harder. That's my approach and goal when providing not just software development but any kind of service or product.

### 🌍 Marketing – Beyond Website Developent

> [_"Every skill you add to your skill toolbelt makes the rest of your skills more valuable."_ – Alex Hormozi](https://youtube.com/shorts/M0Mq_q3gVXA?si=iuBANp5p1ZK4KSjz)

Besides the website, my client also asked me for help regarding the following:

**Google Business Account**  
My client has been working at his current hairdresser shop for years. He didn't own the place initially but eventually took it over. He also took over the existing Google Business Account and instead of renaming the existing profile, he created a second profile on the same account which resulted in the Google search results displaying the name of the new and the name of the old business. I did some research and found out my client's option to solve the problem and shared it with him:

1. Delete the old profile which ...

```diff
+ ... would remove the name of the old business.
- ... would also delete all his 80+ reviews with an average rating of 4.7 ★.
```

2. Request Google to merge the old profile into the new one ...

```diff
+ ... would move over all existing reviews to the new profile.
- ... request could take up to two weeks and still be rejected.
```

My client wanted to choose the first option as he thought he could get new reviews quickly. I told him the decision is up to him, but if I was in his shoes, I'd choose the second option first because he had nothing to lose and everything to win with it. If Google accepted the request he would get to keep all his great reviews which we could use on the website as social proof of how great his service is. If he waited two weeks and his request was rejected, he could still delete the old profile. He liked my suggestion chose that path. I also updated his opening hours, cover picture, logo and also the website address once it went live.

**Apple Business Account**  
During the project I came to the realization that Apple users don't use Google Maps, they use Apple Maps instead. I informed my client about it, created him an Apple Business Account, did everything necessary to claim his existing shop on Apple Maps and updated everything like on Google Maps by the end of the project. By the time of this writing, the claim of the business profile and the changes to it are still being reviewed by Apple.

**Logo**  
With the photo I took of my client's logo, I tried to figure out its digital color code. Because of variables like lighting, camera and display quality, it was impossible for me to get exactly the original color of the logo. Instead of just picking a random color, I decided to go to [Open color](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/), an awesome open-source color scheme, and choose the color that came closest to my clients logo. I ended up with [LIME 5](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/#lime) (HEX code `#94d82d`). I also tried to find a font family that came close to that of the logo, but I hated every result I ended up with. Through sheer luck I ended up on a web tool called [WhatTheFont](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont), which identifies the original font family of any uploaded image. After that, I just searched the font family package online, in preview mode I wrote the name of the shop of my customer, made a screenshot of it, applied the right color and – besides the color – had the exact same logo as my client of his window. Here's the result:

![Logo of my client's business](https://i.postimg.cc/rpR8q576/seren-logo.png)

**Instagram QR code**  
My client wanted me to make him a QR code of a link to his Instagram. He agreed to my suggestion of additionally creating one with a direct link for people to leave a review on Google and printing both on self-adhesive paper so he could easily stick it wherever he wanted. I ordered the paper on Amazon, searched for inspiration on Google, selected a few ideas I liked and created a few samples of which my customer could chose from. I personalized/edited the two chosen options with the free web based photoshop tool [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), generated the QR codes on [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/) and brought everything together. By the end of the project I also got the idea of doing the same for the website so that my client could stick it on his entrance door and enable curious passersby to explore and close (say yes to) the services of my client entirely on their own – effectively making the sale themselves without any effort from my client. Here are the results:

![QR code of my client's Instagram page link](https://i.postimg.cc/qMRvZkMK/instagram-github.png)
![QR code of my client's Google review link](https://i.postimg.cc/PJ6rr7KN/google-review-github.png)
![QR code of my client's website link](https://i.postimg.cc/SxYNkD9N/website-github.png)

After addeding the QR codes here, I noticed that in the first two I addressed the reader formally (with "Sie") on the left, while addressing him informally ("Scanne") on the right. That was a mistake and I should have used informal language to stay consistent with the brand just as throughout the whole website.

## 🎨 Design

> [_"Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."_ – Steve Jobs](https://youtu.be/xNqs_S-zEBY?si=VXJzYMtIZnqpYrXy)

> [!NOTE]
> Check out how old the linked video from above is...

I take a pragmatic (practical) approach, when it comes to design. In my opinion, the main goal of design should – and I rarely use the words should and must – be to reach a specific predefined goal. When it comes to software and products or services in general, that means enhancing the user experience in a way that facilitates the necessary process for the user to reach his goals.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to apply [the 80/20 principle](https://youtu.be/ymiBDged-eQ?si=9DHxs5lHSSMWQVpB&t=709) to design, simply study the videos below to learn _all essential principles needed_ to master what I call _functional design_. And don't get fooled by the impression that the principles in the videos only apply to web development just because all examples are from website design. The principles can be applied to anythink you can imagine. Remember the introductory quote from [the last chapter](#-website-layout)? On top of being able to copy the essence of a thing to create a similar thing within a specific domain, you can also do the same across different domains like from IT to relationships to give you an extreme example. People usually mistake this for **_invention_**, when in reality it's simply **_adaptation_** that leads to what we call **_innovation_**:

### 🧱 Layout

> [_"Don't reinvent the wheel, just realign it."_ – Anthony D'Angelo](https://youtu.be/1WCPJzU3c3E?si=Oknml6jft9FJwNBy)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

The complexity of any kind of layout can be simplified by breaking it down into the following parts:

- Atoms
- Molecules
- Organisms
- Templates
- Pages

Here's what each part means:

- Atoms
  - These are the basic building blocks of the molecules and cannot be broken down further into smaller parts.
  - General example: Bricks and mortar.
  - Website example: Labels and input fields.
- Molecules
  - Molecules are simple groups of atoms functioning together as a unit.
  - General Example: Walls (made from bricks and mortar).
  - Website example: Form fields (made from labels and input fields).
- Organisms
  - Organisms are relatively complex components composed of groups of molecules and atoms, forming distinct sections.
  - General Example: Rooms (made from walls, a roof, windows and an entrance).
  - Website example: Contact forms (made from form fields and buttons).
- Templates
  - Templates provide high level structures by arranging organisms into layouts, serving as blueprints that define content placement without the need of defining any specific content.
  - General Example: Living room blueprint.
  - Website example: Contact form wireframe.
- Pages
  - Pages are instances of templates filled with real content, representing what users will actually see and interact with.
  - General Example: 3D model of a living room (complete with furniture, lighting, and decoration).
  - Website example: Contact form prototype (filled with actual labels, placeholder text, and functional buttons that return the desired outcome based on the input in the input fields).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a model (from the book [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/)) of a problem-solving approach called "first principles thinking". The core message is to break down a problem into its smallest possible components, most basic, fundamental truths and build your solution from there. Here are some key features of this approach:
>
> - **Breaks Down Assumptions:** It helps you identify and challenge assumptions that may limit creativity or lead to suboptimal solutions.
> - **Focuses on Fundamentals:** By starting from the most basic truths, you work with solid, undeniable facts instead of inherited beliefs or conventional wisdom.
> - **Encourages Innovation:** This approach often leads to novel insights and solutions because it forces you to rethink problems from the ground up rather than relying on existing frameworks.
> - **Builds Efficient Solutions:** Stripping a problem to its core components often reveals simpler or (waaaay) more efficient ways to solve it.
> - **Universal Applicability:** It can be applied to anything that need problem solving like science, business, engineering, personal challenges.
>
> This is the approach the most successful scientists, engineers and businesses take to create truly great things.

While I wanted to create something great, I also wanted to do the project as efficiently as possible. I didn't know shit about fuck regarding landing pages. So for me to run towards the right direction instead of running backwards – due to my ignorance of having no prior experience and to save an invaluable amount of time – the same principle I used for the questionnaire I also applied to create the layout. Rather than trying to come up with the layout on my own, I copied the best ones that already exists and adjusted it to my use case. For that I searched "best landing page" on YouTube and analyzed the instructions from the video [Why is THIS the PERFECT Landing Page?](https://youtu.be/UC9pTtrhFys?si=cNwzowfQ-rYf-yz3).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While my initial intention was to simply find a layout template, the video above went beyond website layout and additionally covered behavioural psychology in regards to customers' buying decisions. The insights I gained from them played a big role in the success of my content creation process. We're going to dive deep into that in the content creation chapter.

**🎯 RESULTS**

With the blueprint gathered from the last video mentioned as a starting point, here's the layout I decided to implement in the exact order it is displayed on the website:

> [!NOTE]
> To give you some context on why I made the following layout decisions, I'm already going into the content aspect to a certain extent, before we get to the content chapter itself later on. After gaining more insights and understanding from the content chapter, I advise you to review the following examples to gain an even better practical understanding by linking the different concepts together. This interconnected thinking will help you apply the knowledge more effectively to your individual use case.

**Navbar (enhances user experience)**

- While the blueprint I used told me to leave out the nav to lead force the user to take the optimal path to the CTA (Call To Action), I didn't want to cause a bad user experience by taking control away from him, as that's something I hate myself. So I decided to implement it.
- Includes from left to right:
  - Logo (with a hyperlink to he top of the homepage).
  - Descriptive single word for each section (except the CTA).
  - Highlighted CTA to the correspondent section.

**Hero (emotinally and logically grabs user's attention)**

- Left half from top to bottom:
  - Heading: Emotion based promise of an outcome.
  - Subheading: Logic based explanation on how to achieve it.
  - CTA (Call to action): Action the user needs to take to directly achieve the desired result. It's written as clearly and with as few words as possible.
  - CTA alternative: Second option the user can take if he isn't convinced by the hero section and needs more proof. It leads the user to the following section.
  - Google reviews rating: Displays the average Google reviews rating and the amount of reviews it's based on to add social proof and create trust.
- Right half: Image

**Benefits (emotional proof)**

- Heading: Doesn't just describe what the section is about but conveys what value it adds to the user.
- 3 (magic number) benefits (results instead of things) the service provides to the user with the following layout for each benefit component:
  - Descriptive icon.
    - A picture is worth a thousand words.
    - Visuals help us understand ideas about 6x better than just text alone.
  - Heading: (Emotional) result of the benefit described in 1-3 words.
  - Subheading: (Logical) proof on how the benefit is achieved/the explanation of the thing or feature you provide to make it possible described in 1-3 short sentences.

**Features (logical proof)**

- Heading: See "Benefits".
- Simply list **all** features you provide with your services so that the user has overwhelming (logical) proof to accept your offer. Add an icon like a checkmark to each feature instead of just bullet points to make it more visually appealing. Only add a short description to a feature if strictly necessary for the user to understand what the feature is about, but before doing that, try fixing it by rephrasing the feature itself.

**Reviews (social proof)**

- If you don't have reviews, you could also display logos of businesses you've helped with your product or service instead.
- Ask your customers to give you a review. [The best time to ask for that is at the moment of greatest satisfaction](https://youtube.com/shorts/B0VXkSmBrbQ?si=rnae2OBG8MG5mlUg), right after delivering them their dream outcome with your product or service. You may already have great reviews but might not be aware of it. Here are some places you should consider looking for it:
  - Google Maps and Apple Maps.
  - Comments on your social media:
    - Instagram.
    - Facebook.
    - LinkedIn.
  - Email.
- Choose the 3 (magic number) best reviews you have based on these things ordered from highest to lowest priority:
  - It mentions at least one of the following:
    - How your offer helped reach a specific goal with the best result possible e.g. "$1'000 investment and 100'000 profit" or "80% time/money saved in X with the help of the service".
    - It proves a benefit of using what you offer.
    - Talks about how the user overcame a common objection so that the customer can relate to his personal fears and you grab his attention e.g. "At first I thought it was pretty expensive, but the amount of money and time I saved as a result of this investment, made it all worth it!"
  - Has a photo of the customer.
  - Has the name of the customer.
  - Best rating
  - Proof is from recent times as it's more compelling than old proof (5 days vs 5 years old proof)
- Layout from top to bottom for each of the reviews:
  - Heading: See "Benefits".
  - 5 stars icons: Visually displays the best rating possible even when the user skims through the page and doesn't take the time to read the reviews.
  - Review text: 1-2 very short straight to the point sentences of just text passages of a review to increase the likelihood that users actually read the text.
  - Image of the author: This makes the review appear more authentic.
  - Name of the author: This also makes it appear more authentic.

**Gallery (visual proof)**

- Visual proof is the best there is.
  - Here's a list of visual media types starting with the most convincing:
    - Video + audio
    - Video
    - Photo or Screenshot (real image)
    - Illustration (image created by an artist or AI)
  - If possible use before and after comparisons.
- I went with photos of the results from my clients services.
  - If it were my business, I would have created different photos because – especially in this case – they're the most important elements on the website. I made suggestions to my client, but since he wasn't willing to do the work – and I decided to set boundaries on what responsibilities I was and wasn't willing to take on –, I focused only on what I could control and made the best of the resources he provided.

**Offer (logical proof)**

- Have you ever spent what felt like an eternity to try and find a movie or serie on Netflix, only to not find nothing at all and decide to do something else? That's known as analysis paralysis. It's the feeling of being unable to make a decision due to overthinking a problem and often happens when a person's dealing with too many variables/options. Netflix mitigated this problem with providing you with different top 10 lists that are based on things like your location, viewing history and other members with similar taste. If you want your user to take you up on any offer at all, don't overwhelm him with too many options. Generally speaking, the optimal number is – you guessed it – 3 options. But this number may vary between industries and existing services. Just make sure your offer is conveyed as simple as possible with as few words as possible, while still maintaining the essential impactful information needed.
- I tried to seek inspiration from different hairdresser websites. After many horrible websites I decided to switch gears and looked around on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/), which is a self-promotion platform for digital designers. There I've found many examples I liked and by combining single elements that I liked from different examples, I created my own design.

**FAQ (emotional fears)**

- The frequently asked questions section resolves common questions users might have about your product or service and most important their personal fears that are based on past bad experiences and misconceptions. Here are some pressure points:
  - Money
  - Time
  - Trust
- Choose 5-6 questions and provide an answer to them, ideally with some proof.
- Layout:
  - Heading: Question
  - Paragraph: Answer. Since this taps into the customer's fears – which is the strongest form of motivation – and grabs their attention, you can get away with writing longer text than the rest of the content on the website, but should still try to be concise and precise.

**CTA (purpose of the website)**

- The primary purpose of the website is to encourage the user to act upon the call to action, so that you can help him solve whatever problem or reach whatever goal he has. Therefore, one should take as much time as needed to make all the effort put into the development of the website worthwhile. Start the development of the website thinking about and writing the CTA and after finishing writing all the content, revisit it and try to rewrite it such that it's more concise and can be understood more clearly by the user.
- Layout:
  - Heading: Same as in the hero section.
  - Paragraph: Elaborate on the heading and the subheading of the hero.
  - Button: Direct call to action that describes what's going to happen when the user presses the button.

```diff
- **Bad** example: Call us now!
  => The user doesn't know why to call.
+ **Good** example: Call now and book a consultation!
  => Describes exactly what's going to happen and why.

> [_"Size, cosmically speaking, doesn't matter. Only space. And even the smallest of spaces can hold the vastest of universes."_ – Ramy Vance](https://youtube.com/shorts/EdD6_ACHV58?si=WvTsnYb7MjhQSeDC)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

Here are some principles to use size and spacing effectively:

- Objects that are positioned close to one another create the impression of being closely related. This effect becomes even more noticeable when other objects are spaced farther apart, emphasizing the proximity of the closer ones.

1. Visual Hierarchy

- Use size to prioritize elements and guide the viewer's attention, making important content stand out.  
  Example: Headlines should be larger than body text, and primary buttons should stand out more than secondary ones.

2. Consistency
   Maintain consistent spacing and sizing throughout the design to create a harmonious and professional appearance.  
   Example: Use a design system (this has its own chapter) or grid with fixed margins, paddings, and font sizes across all elements.

3. White Space (Negative Space)
   Allow sufficient empty space around and between elements to prevent clutter and enhance readability.  
   Example: Leave breathing room around text, buttons, and images to create a clean and organized layout.

> [!TIP]
> Start with plenty of space, then refine it by making big adjustments first, followed by smaller and smaller steps, going back and forth between too little and too much, until you find the balance you're happy with. Think of it like sculpting a statue: You begin by removing large chunks of material, then gradually carve out finer details until the form feels just right.

4. Proportional Scaling
   Maintain proportional relationships between elements to ensure visual balance and alignment.  
   Example: Use a modular scale or the golden ratio (1.618) to determine sizes for text, images, and other components.

- Paragraph font size = 18px
- Subheading 2 font size = paragraph font size [18px] \* golden ratio [1.618] = 29px
- Subheading 1 font size = subheading 2 font size [29px] \* golden ratio [1.618] = 47px
- Heading font size = subheading 1 font size [47px] \* golden ratio [1.618] = 76px

5. Grouping and Proximity
   Position related elements closer together while moving unrelated ones further apart to visually convey their relationships.  
   Example: In a contact form, group labels and input fields together, while separating other parts like heading and buttons with additional spacing.

6. Alignment
   Align elements consistently (left, center, or right) to establish order and, as a result, improve readability.  
   Example: All headings are aligned to the left.

7. Responsive Design
   Adapt size and spacing dynamically based on screen size or resolution to ensure usability across devices.  
   Example: Instead of fixed pixel values, use flexible relative units (like percentages or em/rem) that automatically adapt the size of elements (e.g. an image) to any given screen size.

8. Contrast
   Use size and spacing to create contrast between elements, making certain parts more noticeable than others.  
   Example: Highlight a call-to-action button by making it larger and giving it plenty surrounding space.

9. Legibility
   Ensure text sizes and line spacing (leading) are optimized for readability across all screen sizes.  
   Example: Set line height to 1.5x the font size and avoid text that is too small or cramped.

10. Alignment with Content Purpose
    Adjust size and spacing to reflect the importance or nature of the content.
    Example: Use larger images and headings for a hero section, while keeping footer elements smaller and compact.

11. Rhythm and Balance
    Use consistent spacing patterns (e.g. for padding or margins) to create a rhythm that feels natural and visually balanced (and save tons of time + avoid unnecessary long-term suffering).  
    Example: Establish a spacing scale (e.g., 2px(+2 =>), 4px(+4 =>), 8px(+6) ... 128px ) to ensure harmony throughout the design.

12. Feedback and Interaction
    Ensure spacing and size make interactive elements easy to identify and use.  
    Example: Make buttons large enough and with sufficient spacing to prevent accidental clicks by the user during touch interaction.

### 🌈 Color

> [_"Color is a power which directly influences the soul."_ – Wassily Kandinsky](https://youtube.com/shorts/-_W6l_mtdIo?si=X7RdbOnNrqBlC8zT)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

Colors evoke specific emotions or associations due to a mix of biological responses, cultural meanings, and personal experiences. Use colors that evoke the specific feelings you want to be associated with your offer.

Here's a list of the most important and commonly recognized colors, along with their primary associations:  
**Primary Colors**

- Red: Energy, passion, urgency.
- Blue: Trust, calmness, stability.
- Yellow: Happiness, optimism, warmth.

**Secondary Colors** (Created by mixing primary colors)

- Green: Nature, growth, harmony.
- Orange: Creativity, enthusiasm, friendliness.
- Purple: Luxury, creativity, wisdom.

**Neutral Colors**

- Black: Power, elegance, sophistication.
- White: Purity, simplicity, cleanliness.
- Gray: Neutrality, balance, practicality.
- Brown: Earthiness, stability, reliability.

**Tertiary or Highlight Colors**

- Cyan: Freshness, clarity, modernity.
- Magenta: Boldness, vibrancy, energy.
- Gold: Prestige, wealth, success.
- Silver: Elegance, modernity, innovation.

#### 👉 Choosing colors

Use the classic design principle called **"60-30-10 rule"** to create balanced and harmonious color schemes. The percentages are a reference to how much of each color is used in the design:

- **60%: Dominant color** (main background or base color, like walls or large surfaces).
- **30%: Secondary color** (complements the dominant, used for furniture or upholstery).
- **10%: Accent color** (pops of color for accessories like pillows, artwork, or decorations).

This ratio ensures visual interest without overwhelming the design. The less of a color there is, the more it stands out and this increases its importance. So use it to intentionally guide the user's attention, but use it sparingly.

If you want to use more than three colors, do as follows:

1. Adjust Dominance

- Keep one dominant color at 60%.
- Introduce up to 5 non-dominant colors (1 dominant + max 5 = 6 total to avoid losing impact) without exceeding 40% combined.

2. Split the 30% or 10%:

- Divide the 30% (secondary color) into complementary shades (e.g. 20% and 10%) based on their importance.
- Split the 10% (accent color) into smaller pops, e.g., 5% each for two accents.

3. Harmonize

- Ensure all colors work together, using a unifying tone, hue, or theme (use the tools mentioned below).

The easiest way to use colors effectively is to use the minimum amount of different colors as possible. You can get away with using one single color (with different tones), but I feel like three colors is the sweet spot. That's what I went with in my project and that's what for example [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) (white, black, red), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) (black, white, red) and [Meta (Facebook)](https://www.meta.com/) (white, black, blue) use.

I have two approaches for choosing my three colors:  
**First approach**

1. Start with the primary color. It's the color that will be used most in whatever it is you're creating. Let's say it's black like the background of the editor I'm currently using.
2. Then choose a secondary color, which has a high contrast (think light vs dark) to the primary color. This color will be the second most used color. Let's say white, like the color of the text I'm writing.
3. Lastly, choose an accent color that has a high contrast to the primary color. It should especially stands out from the other two colors, because its goal is catch the user's attention to highlight important things. Let's say a blue like the standard blue of the links you've seen in this documentation.

**Second approach**

1. Start with the accent color. This approach is best used for when you have an existing brand color.
2. Choose the primary color, which – like in the first approach – should have a high contrast to the accent color.
3. Choose the secondary color like in the first approach.

#### 👥 Tints and Shades

After deciding what colors you want to use, you'll also need tints (darker versions) and shades (darker versions) for situations like:

- Increasing/reducing the importance of elements.
- Visual feedback on user interactions with the user interface.
- Ensure accessibility for people with visual impairments with a high enough contrast ratio.

Choose between those three approaches:

1. Time efficient approach  
   Use existing tints and shades from some online resource. Tailwind CSS – a very popular CSS framework among developers – offers a beautiful, well-organized [color palette with predefined tints and shades](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) that you can easily copy and paste into your designs for a professional look. Keep it simple, though:
   - Just take a color range like neutral (white to black and their shades in between) for the primary and secondary color.
   - Choose an accent color like red (including its tints and shades)
2. Individualized approach
   If you have specific colors in mind including their color code, use a tool like [Tint and Shade Generator](https://maketintsandshades.com/) to generate tints and shades yourself. Even if you do choose a custom color, I'd advise you to copy the color system from Tailwind. Let's take azure (HEX: `#007FFF` from Microsoft Azure) as an example:

- Copy the tints in 20% increments from the base color except for the last one, where you do a 10% increment.
- Do the same thing for the shades.

Here's how this would look like visually:  
![example of how to create tints and shades](https://i.ibb.co/Msvdmt9/how-to-create-tints-and-shades.png)

3. Mixed approach

- Generate the custom colors and their tints and shades with a tool like
- Copy the rest from a ressource like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
- With this approach you get the best from both worlds (that's what I did for this project)

#### 🛠️ Ressources and Tools

    - [Realtime Colors v3](https://youtu.be/zy7Kf8WiSyE?si=iuEA0Vr9xJrZ1xFr)

**🎯 RESULTS**

**Primary color:** Black (HEX: #171717)
In addition to the fact that it has an ultra high contrast to the accent color, I chose black because of the following assossiations:

- Power (authority, strength, and dominance)
- Formality (seriousness and professionalism)
- Simplicity (minimalism and clarity)

Don't choose pure black (#000000), because it doesn't feel natural and is harsh on our eyes. Choose a slightly softer black to create a more natural and visually comfortable appearance instead.

**Secondary color:** White (HEX: `#e5e5e5`)
Creates the best possible contrast to black, and strengthens the assossiation of simplicity and formality.

Don't choose pure white (`#ffffff`) for the same reasons I just mentioned for pure black.

**Accent color:** Lime (HEX: `#94d82d`)
As described in the marketing chapter, I chose it because it came closest to the color of my client's logo. The other color choices were based on this one.

**Neutral tints and shades:**  
`#fafafa`  
`#f5f5f5`  
`#e5e5e5`(secondary base)  
`#d4d4d4`  
`#a3a3a3`  
`#737373`  
`#525252`  
`#404040`  
`#262626`  
`#171717`(primary base)  
`#0a0a0a`

I copied this from Tailwind.

**Lime tints and shades:**  
`#f4fbea`  
`#eaf7d5`  
`#d4efab`  
`#bfe881`  
`#a9e057`  
`#94d82d`(accent base)  
`#76ad24`  
`#59821b`  
`#3b5612`  
`#1e2b09`  
`#0f1604`

I custom made this.

### ✒️ Typography

> [_"Lettering differs from type in the same way that modeling clay differs from LEGO® bricks."_ – Mark Simonson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcgCwnLSoYw)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

Typography is about arranging text (letters, numbers, symbols) in a way that makes it readable, visually appealing, and impactful.

The most fundamental and practical knowledge about typography is **readability** and **hierarchy**:

**Readability**
Ensure text is easy to read by choosing appropriate fonts, sizes, spacing, and contrast. Prioritize legibility, especially for body text, with clean, well-designed typefaces and sufficient line spacing.

**Hierarchy**
Use typography to guide the reader's attention by creating a visual structure:

- Headings: Use larger, bold font for emphasis.
- Subheadings: Slightly smaller or lighter styles to show the relationship to the heading.
- Body text: Consistent, simple styles for readability.
- Emphasis: Use bold, italics, or color sparingly to highlight key points.

> [!TIP]
> Except for the hero section, by emphasizing the subheading instead of the heading, you can draw attention to key details or provide clarity through a descriptive subheading.

By applying these principles you ensure your text communicates your message effectively and engages the audience the way you intend to.

#### 🔠 Typeface

> [!TIP]
> People usually use the different terms "typeface, font, typography" as synonyms. That's simply not right and this caused me some confusion in the beginning. Here's what each term means and their relation to one another to give you some clarity:
>
> - **Typefaces** are character families (e.g. Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman).
> - **Fonts** are styles or designs of a specific typeface (e.g. regular, bold, italic). Fonts are variations/instances of typefaces.
> - **Typography** – as mentioned above – is the technique of arranging text (letters, numbers, symbols) to make written language legible, readable, and visually appealing. Typefaces are elements/tools of typography.

The most fundamental and practical knowledge about fonts is **appropriateness** and **consistency**:

**Appropriateness**
Choose fonts that match the purpose and tone of your content.

- Serif fonts: Traditional and formal.
- Sans-serif fonts: Modern and clean (easier to read).
- Display fonts: Bold and decorative.
- Monospace fonts: Technical and structured.

**Consistency**
Limit the number of fonts (1-3) to maintain a cohesive look.

- Pair complementary fonts: Use one for headings and another for body text.
- Ensure weights, styles, and sizes create a design with harmony.

> [!TIP]
> The more typefaces you use, the more time you need to spend to get it right and the bigger the risk of messing it up. So simply choose one single typeface. I'd also advise you to choose a sans-serif typeface because they're easier to read than serif typefaces.

Here's a [list of typeface suggestions](https://fonts.google.com/share?selection.family=DM+Sans:ital,opsz,wght@0,9..40,100..1000;1,9..40,100..1000|Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900|Lato:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,700;1,900|Lexend:wght@100..900|Montserrat:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900|Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,300..800;1,300..800|Roboto:ital,wght@0,100;0,300;0,400;0,500;0,700;0,900;1,100;1,300;1,400;1,500;1,700;1,900|Source+Sans+3:ital,wght@0,200..900;1,200..900|Work+Sans:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900):

- Inter
- Open Sans
- Lato
- Work Sans
- Roboto
- Lexend
- Source Sans 3
- Montserrat
- DM Sans

**🎯 RESULTS**

I chose the font family "Open Sans":  
![Example of all characters of the font family Open Sans](https://i.ibb.co/7Wt60Dw/font-family.png)

Those were the reasons for my decision:

- Sans serif typeface.
  - Increased readability.
  - Minimalistic and simple.
- Consists mainly of straight lines and has plenty of space between characters.
  - Minimalistic and simple.
  - Increased readability.
- Subtle round edges at the letters "g" and "y".
  - A bit of sophistication and elegance softens/reduces the stiffness of the straight lines of the other characters and adds calm and peace.

As a fallback (in case Open Sans isn't available) I chose the generic font-family "sans-serif".

As for font weight, I used:

- Default: 400 (e.g. body text)
- Semi-Bold: 600 (e.g. heading 3)
- Bold: 700 (e.g. heading 1 and 2)

### 🖼 Images and Icons

> [_"A picture is worth a thousand words"_ – Fred R. Barnard](https://youtube.com/shorts/kkcRaN240ss?si=VDR1h1cn-ctrpA5p)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

> [!TIP]
> I didn't write the following text on my own. To save time and test how ChatGPT summarizes large amounts of text, I let it summarize the blog post [Is Every Picture Worth 1,000 Words?](https://ia.net/topics/is-every-picture-worth-1000-words). For that I first told ChatGPT what I wanted, explained the problem of not being able to sent it the whole text at once, asked it to tell me exactly how to make it work and to create me the exact orders I should give. One important takeaway was to only use a max. of 2'000 characters (not words) for the GPT o1 model and 3'000-4'000 for the GPT 4 model. I broke the whole blog text down into small chunks, let ChatGPT summarize each one of it, did the same process twice more to summarize the summaries until I ended up with the text below. Check out the blog post to see magnificent good and bad examples of how images should and shouldn't be used.
>
> P.S. I only found the article during the writing of this documentation.

To create clear and impactful presentations, **balance the use of visuals and text** by understanding their unique strengths and how they work together. Use **images** for quick comprehension, emotional impact, and clarity, and rely on **text** for details, explanations, and abstract concepts. Avoid clichés like "a picture is worth a thousand words" and only use visuals that genuinely enhance your message rather than serving as placeholders.

Choose **visuals that tell a clear story** and reflect **modern contexts** with diversity and authenticity. Avoid outdated or superficial stock images that can undermine your message. Before selecting an image, **ask critical questions** to ensure it communicates the intended message and adds value. Don't use placeholders that are merely decorative.

Develop a **balanced approach** by asking yourself what emotion or message you want to convey and whether it's best communicated through images, text, or both. **Practice minimalism** by keeping your messaging clear and concise, ensuring every word and image serves a purpose. **Avoid redundancy** – don't describe what's obvious in an image; instead, provide new insights or context.

Ensure **text and visuals align** in tone, style, and message. When placing images side by side, maintain **consistency** in color, style, and resolution to avoid distractions. If images clash, insert a text slide between them. **Use comparisons intentionally** to highlight key differences or create a compelling story.

To achieve **synergy**, make sure text and visuals complement each other: the text should clarify or enhance the image, and the image should bring the text to life. **Balance the strengths** of both – images for emotional impact and clarity, and text for detail and context. Focus on **quality over quantity**; a few well-chosen visuals are more powerful than many generic ones. Remember, **less is more** – avoid clutter to maintain clarity.

Finally, **rehearse your presentation** and seek feedback from others. Critically evaluate if your visuals and text flow smoothly, reinforce your message, and engage your audience. By thoughtfully applying these principles, you can create presentations where visuals and text work together to deliver a **clear, engaging, and memorable message**.

When choosing icons sets and deciding on image border radius, remember this:

- Sharp edges give a sense of structure, conservatism, tradition, preciseness, professionalism, efficiency, harshness, seriousness.
- Round edges give a sense of flexibility, creativity, modernity, innovation, casualness, softness, playfulness.

You don't have to choose one or the other. See it as a spectrum. Depending on your brand, you can lean more towards one or the other, but after deciding on for example mostly sharp edges, choose 1 single border radius and 1 single icon set that gives that impression and stick to it.

**🎯 RESULTS**

Here are three examples:

The image on the right should represent a confident customer after a haircut. I used the best Image I had at my exposal, but still, the customer has basically no emotion at all on his face, and the image doesn't support the promise of the offer, leading to a huge percentage of visitors leaving the website within the first 3-5 seconds. The Google ratings average I added acts as social proof and mitigates the damage to some extent:  
![example of proper combination of image and text](https://i.ibb.co/mb5t1s3/use-of-image-with-text-example.png)

The icons tell the user what the content is about and the heading adds specificity:  
![example of proper combination of icon and text](https://i.ibb.co/BTLw6dS/use-of-icon-with-text-example-1.png)

The icons help the user navigate the offers to find what he's looking for more quickly:  
![example of proper combination of icon and text](https://i.ibb.co/JpTF8gf/use-of-icon-with-text-example-2.png)

By the way, I used Google's [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons). Instead of using their API (fetching the icons from their server every time a page is loaded), I hard coded it (copied the SVG and pasted it directly inside the HTML). When working on a big project, I'd suggest using the API for better code readability and maintainability.

### 📱 Responsiveness

> [_"In life, change is inevitable. In business, change is vital."_ – Warren G. Bennis](https://youtube.com/shorts/8XO04S_Ch6w?si=IZgf8FnNogJ4d_IL)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

When planning a website, you have to keep responsiveness in mind throughout the whole design and implementation process. You don't want to invest a lot of time to create something that's really fancy and unique only to find out afterwards, that it only works/looks good on desktop PCs but terrible on mobile phones.

While keeping responsiveness in mind, I chose the desktop-first design, where you design and implement the website for large screen sizes like desktop PCs first. With that you optimize the website for desktops. Once you're done, you then check how it looks on smaller and smaller screen sizes and fix the design where it is not optimal or even breaks along the way. The second option, is called mobile-first design, where you optimize for mobile and then fix the design for bigger and bigger screens step by step.

Here are some general guidelines to design just about anything:

- Create components that can be rearranged, replaced, or reused without affecting the overall structure.
  - Prefabricated building blocks that can be reconfigured.
- Ensure the design maintains functionality and appearance at different sizes or scales.
  - Chosing images that don't have too much detail which wouldn't be visible when displayed in smaller scales.
- Use adjustable parameters or rules to generate variations of the design.
  - Creating a flexible T-shirt that adapts to the user's body type within a certain range of variability.
- Design with multiple versions and tests in mind and change based on test results.
  - Creating prototypes to test before going all-in on an idea that was destined to fail from the start.
- Allow for content or design elements that can change based on context or user preference.
  - Selling ice cream where the customer can choose the topping, based on his personal taste.
- Use a consistent framework that maintains order while allowing flexibility.
  - Using SVG files icons that always displays it in the best possible resolution instead of PNG files that make it pixelated when increasing the size.
- Design with potential changes or expansions in mind.
- Create designs in layers, where elements can be added or removed without disrupting the core structure.
  - For a website, the content layer (HTML) is separated from its styling (CSS). One can be changed without directly affecting the other.
  - Choose to provide products or services in a domain (e.g. health, money making, relationship) for which the demand won't ever be negatively affected by external changes and most likely grow in the future.

In regards to web development, HTML (content and structure) is inherently responsive. Responsiveness only becomes a problem, when the developer doesn't know about that innate responsiveness of HTML and because of that introduces bugs through CSS (style). It's like designing an adjustable belt but adding holes in the wrong places so it no longer fits different sizes properly.

**🎯 RESULTS**

Some examples:

- Instead of using a fixed pixel values for images and text, I used variable values like percentages that automatically adapt to the current screen size.

- There is a navigation dedicated to desktop and one to mobile devices to provide the best possible user experience.

  - Desktop  
    ![desktop navigation](https://i.ibb.co/pKj7yL0/navbar-desktop.png)
  - Mobile closed  
    ![mobile navigation closed](https://i.ibb.co/pysqD4C/navbar-mobile-closed.png)
  - Mobile open  
    ![mobile navigation open](https://i.ibb.co/5GJ1fhs/navbar-mobile-open.png)

- I used layout concepts like flexbox and grid to be able to adapt the whole layout of sections with one simple change. In the following example, I just had to set 2 columns for each row to 1 column for each row:

![responsive flexbox example desktop](https://i.ibb.co/G9qffTq/flexbox-example-desktop.png)  
![responsive flexbox example mobile](https://i.ibb.co/sF1GGT8/responsive-flexbox-example-mobile.png)

### ♾️ Consistency

> [_"Consistency Beats Talent, Luck, Good Intentions, and Even Quality."_ – Unknown](https://youtube.com/shorts/9ViRrTTPEJM?si=_yS3EhoyjBX3tfCj)

Below is a summary of some of the key elements when it comes to consistency for almost all chapters in this documentation. Some of them were already mentioned in their respective chapter but look at this as a consolidated reference to reinforce their importance:

- 📅 Meetings

  - Use a standard template or outline for all client meetings to make the process more efficient and avoid confusion.
  - Keep meeting frequency and communication methods consistent (e.g. always in-person meetings and milestone completion confirmations through something like Whatsapp).

- 🌍 Marketing – Beyond Website Development

  - Ensure the brand's voice, tone, and value offer remain consistent across all marketing channels, not just the website.

- 🎨 Design

  - Write down decisions (colors, fonts, spacing) and the reason behind them, to be able to keep track of them and communicate them effectively.
  - Apply a unified style throughout the whole website.

- 🧱 Layout

  - Maintain grid system and layout patterns similar so users quickly recognize how to navigate different sections.
  - Place navigation, headers, footers, and main content areas in locations the users are used to or at least the same across pages.

- ↔️ Size and Spacing

  - Use a standardized scale for spacing (e.g. a spacing system with set increments) to ensure a cohesive look and save time by limiting your choises.
  - Create harmony in the interface (what the user sees) by keeping proportions of elements (padding, margins, and line heights) the same.

- 🌈 Color

  - Stick to a defined color palette (primary, secondary, accent colors) to reinforce brand identity.
  - Apply each color purposefully (60/30/10 rule) so users instantly understand what's important and for example what elements like links can be interacted with.

- 👉 Choosing Colors

  - Document guidelines on selecting colors that align with brand values, ensuring future color additions remain consistent.

- 👥 Tints and Shades

  - Use a standardized method for generating tints and shades (e.g., specific percentage increments of black or white) so color variations feel related and consistent.

- ✒️ Typography

  - Establish a clear typographic scale and apply it consistently to everything to – like in spacing – ensure a cohesive look and save time by limiting your choises.

- 🔠 Typeface

  - Ensure the selected typeface matches the brand's personality and stick to it.

- 🖼 Images and Icons

  - Use a coherent visual style for all images and a uniform icon set so visuals never feel out of place (e.g. all icons either outlined **_or_** filled and rounded **_or_** sharp).
  - Maintain consistent image sizes and formats (e.g. all icons as SVG) to ensure uniform quality and loading times.

- 📱 Responsiveness

  - Define a set of responsive breakpoint ranges (e.g. between 250-300px where the design breaks) and apply them consistently across the entire site.
  - Ensure that fonts, images, and layouts resize following a predictable pattern, so users enjoy a similar experience on any device.

- 🧬 Design System

  - Document all brand assets, styles, and components in one place to ensure that everyone on the team references the same sources.
  - Consistently update the design system with new patterns or elements as they evolve, so the entire product stays coherent.

- 🦿 Prototyping

  - Maintain a similar level of detail across prototypes, ensuring that interactions and design elements are represented uniformly.
  - When updating prototypes, apply feedback changes not only to single parts but to the prototype as a whole, so each revised prototype remains aligned with the established standards.

- 📰 Content Creation

  - Adopt a uniform writing style, tone, and vocabulary that echoes the brand's personality and message.
  - Use consistent headings, formatting styles, and punctuation rules across all written content.

- 🧠 Market Research

  - Set clear goals and objectives to consistently stay on the task at hand and not drift away from the original scope.
  - Apply standardized methods and criteria on how to collect and evaluate market insights for fair evaluations that reduce personal biases and lead to reliable results.
    - Example: Ask 100 people the exact same question and favor those answers who come up most often to create a theory.
  - Try what's called "triangulation", which involves approaching the same goal from different angles or standardized methods. The higher the consistency throughout the results from these different approaches, the stronger their reliability and validity.

- ✍️ Copywriting
  - Maintain the same key messages throughout the whole copy that tell a cohesive narrative and communicate the brand identity and value proposition to the user.
  - Standardize the editing process, so that all copy is reviewed and refined to lead to the same tone, style and quality before publication.

### 🧬 Design System

> [_"Your systems are perfectly designed to get the results that you are getting."_ – Stephen R. Covey](https://youtube.com/shorts/PAyLQqaU7U4?si=HtHxa7OhkCV7J-PR)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

Generally speaking, systems can be seen as blueprints. A design system is a collection of guidelines, principles, and basic design elements that ensure consistency and efficiency to all development stages. It also provides scalability and makes collaboration way easier throughout projects.

#### 🗝️ Core Components

**Design Tokens**

Design tokens are variables (names) that each store a specific design-related value (that you can change) like colors, font families, icons, font sizes, spacing and shadows. Design tokens normally come in groups of a predefined amount of different values for each group. Here's an example of variables from different groups in CSS code:

```
:root {
  --color-primary: #ffffff;
  --spacing-1: 0.2rem;
  --font-size-5: 1.8rem;
  --border-radius: 3px;
  --color-shadow: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);
  --shadow-default: 0 0.6rem 0.6rem var(--color-shadow);
}
```

Check out this example:

```
/*Before change*/
:root {
  --border-radius: 3px;
}

.gallery__item {
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);    /*border-radius = 3px*/
}
```

```
/*After change*/
:root {
  --border-radius: 6px;   /*changed from 3px to 6px*/
}

.gallery__item {
  border-radius: var(--border-radius);    /*border-radius = 6px*/
}
```

Notice how the reference name `--border-radius` at the class `gallery__item` stays the same after the change and only the value gets updated. Every class like `.gallery__item` has access to the `:root` class. By making use of this feature, design tokens make updating easy by applying changes globally and ensure consistency across the website.

**Component Library**

A collection of reusable UI components like buttons, forms, cards, and navigation menus. Each component should be designed to be consistent, flexible, and accessible.

- Buttons

  - Primary
  - Secondary
  - Tertiary buttons

- Forms

  - Input fields
  - Checkboxes
  - Radio buttons
  - Dropdowns

- Navigation
  - Headers
  - Footers
  - Menus

## 📰 Content Creation

> [_"Content is king!"_ – Bill Gates (**in 1996!**)](https://youtube.com/shorts/0HpkysN5gGQ?si=x9lt-llAJH6FMieb)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

Let's start by defining what content creation is in the first place: Content creation is the process of generating and sharing material, such as text, images, videos, or audio, to inform, entertain, or engage an audience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It doesn't matter if you have the best product or service in the world; you must be able to **provide your offer to the right people that _actually_ need it** and to **communicate _effectively_** why and how your thing will lead them to their personal dream outcome regarding a specific problem, **or else everybody will perceive your offer as _worthless_**.

To maximize conversion rates of website visitors (potential customers) I applied the following key takeaways from the video [Why is THIS the PERFECT Landing Page?](https://youtu.be/UC9pTtrhFys?si=cNwzowfQ-rYf-yz3) mentioned in the layout chapter:

- Don't offer your service or your product to your leads (potential customer), offer them the individual dream outcome they're looking for to an existing problem.
- Create trust by being honest and providing undeniable proof that what you have to offer will get them the promised result.
- Lead the users toward one – and only one – simple and clear action they need to take to reach their desired results.

In addition to the last video mentioned, I also watched the video [Copy This Perfect Landing Page To Double Your Leads Instantly](https://youtu.be/V2_LNtV95jM?si=k1_9B_N1mqqtbFJm&t=827) from the same channel, and, in one minute, by explaining the clear connection between emotions and logic, the video teaches you how people make buying decisions:

- 95% of customers' buying decisions are based on emotions e.g. desires & dreams, fears & suffering etc.
- Emotions change all the time but proof is timeless and validates decisions and claims. To make sure the customer doesn't regret his decision when his emotions change and to cover the missing 5% of a customer's buying decision, the emotional decision needs to be backed up with the logic on how your offer ensures the claimed results e.g. stats, social proof, visual proof, features etc.

### 🧠 Market research

> [_"Make an offer so good people feel stupid saying no"_ – Alex Hormozi](https://youtube.com/shorts/joF2fMj3XKk?si=9uxLZvgPwWB57C8f)

Alex Hormozi has built four different businesses. As of 2020 he had a net worth of $100M (now it's most likely closer to $1B). Even though he doesn't know I exist, he's actually my mentor. A while back he said that he ["looked at 2'000 ads ... of the top 50 ads ... 40 of them was just proof ... it's all it was, proof"](https://youtube.com/shorts/9XIgalr9aWY?si=JpF835J1xvZuYFJx).

I knew I had to do some market research to find out what criteria people have, when it comes to choosing a hairdresser, find my client's strengths and weaknesses, and connect the dots to come up with an offer the target audience would feel stupid saying no to. The basis for my market research was the questionnaire. In addition to the answers that my client gave me, I made some observations that helped me add more specificity to my client's answers and do the remaining ones on my own.

In addition to that, and to find out what motivates the buying decisions specific to my client's customers, I tried to define an avatar. An avatar is a detailed representation of a company's ideal customer/target audience. It's a fictional profile that embodies the characteristics, behaviors, needs, and preferences of the type of person that is qualified to use the products or services of a business so that a so called _"product-market fit"_ is achieved. For that I analysed the following:

- The looks of my client, his employees, the few customer I've seen during my first meeting with my client and of the people my client has uploaded result pictures onto his Instagram profile.
- The personality of my brother who – connected my client and me and – is a regular customer of my client.
- What I personally like and dislike about hairdressing services and why I cut my hair myself instead of going to a hairdresser (check out my profile picture 😄).
- The key values my customer provides with his service. Not just with the end result but also with his process that's unique to his shop and with which he differentiates himself from his competitors.

Alex also showed me ["four things to make the proofs more compelling"](https://youtube.com/shorts/xo7GZF_1eFU?si=UvUkwOWVlWmL1TkQ):

1. Recent proof is better than delayed proof.

- Example: 5 days vs 5 years old proof.

2. Your proof should be as visual as possible.

- Example: Saying you lost 10kg of fat vs showing a before and after picture of it.

3. Use high volume of proof and in the right format.

- Example: Having 100 reviews on Google vs printing every single one of them out, framing them and putting them at your lobby wall from floor to ceiling.

To make the market research process as efficient as possible, I used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) as my market research expert. Here are the key concepts that shaped my approach:

- The quality of the results from ChatGTP depends entirely on the skill of the person crafting the prompts.

> [!WARNING]
> If a CEO knows how to manage his team effectively by providing them with clear guidance and well-defined objectives, the team can focus their efforts and deliver high-quality results. Similarly, when the prompt is precise, well-structured, and detailed, ChatGPT can generate accurate, relevant, and insightful responses. On the other hand, if the CEO gives vague or poorly thought-out instructions, the team might become confused or unproductive. Likewise, a poorly written prompt can lead to generic, irrelevant, or unhelpful responses from ChatGPT.

- Take responsibility and think for yourself instead of leaving that to the AI.
  > [!WARNING]
  > By taking ownership of your thoughts, you ensure that ChatGPT becomes a tool that enhances your capabilities rather than replaces them. ChatGPT provides suggestions, but it's the responsibility of the user to analyze, interpret, and apply those ideas in a thoughtful, ethical, and relevant way. By engaging critically with ChatGPT, you maintain control over the process, achieve more meaningful and personalized results, and improve your own skills over time.

**🎯 RESULTS**

The avatar I came up with:

- Young ambitious man between 16 and 35 years who highly values simplicity, efficiency and are very selective with their time and money.

I kept this avatar in mind throughout the whole market research process.

My client's most important strenghts that match the avatar's values:

- Quick service.
- Good reliable results.
- Low price.

How I decided to prove it (in no specific order):

- Existing Google reviews.
- A lot of result pictures.
- Simple website with a simple design so that the perceived brand image matches the claims of the service.

My client's weaknesses:

1. No security of instant availability due to the rejection of appointments.
2. No card payment options.

How I turned them into strenghts:

1. I made the CTA (Call to action) a direct phone call so that the customer can check the current availability.

- I noted this problem during the first meeting with my client, when he had to reject a customer that came by spontaneously because of our meeting. I knew right away I was going to use this as the CTA.

2. I looked on Google Maps for the nearest ATM (cash machine) and found out there's one on the opposite side of the street of my client's shop.

### ✍️ Copywriting

> [_"If you are an effective writer ... you have all the authority and competence that there is"_ – Jordan B. Peterson](https://youtube.com/shorts/CPY3dG9dcC8?si=YKdm6-vVZFue3bs5)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

Copywriting is about crafting persuasive and compelling text to promote a product, service, or idea and inspire the audience to take specific action.

From my knowledge about neuropsychology (science about how the brain affects human behaviour for example through hormones) and behavioural psychology, but also from personal experience, I know for a fact that ambitious people – who represent our avatar – are usually driven by deep insecurities. As you've already learned, fear is the strongest form of motivation. With that in mind, I wanted my copy to relate to those insecurities to grab the user's attention and to provide them a genuine solution with my client's services. That's not only how I did this project, but how I do many things in my life. But with great power comes great responsibility. That's why philosophy is a big component of my life. I always strive to make choises that have a net positive impact on me **and** the people involved with everything I do. I'm well aware of the limits of my capabilities and I know that I don't always make the right choises. I keep that in mind, but I don't let that stop me. I never regret anything I've done, because the mistakes I make are lessons I can learn from. The only choices I regret are those I knew I should have done, but allowed fear to take over and prevent me from taking action.

In addition to using ChatGPT for market research, I used it for/to:

- Brainstorming countless ideas within seconds.
  - When I didn't like the output I asked my virtual expert to do it again with the simple prompt "again" and repeated it until there was something I found interesting. When that alone wasn't enough, I refined my original command/question and repeated this process.
- Headline suggestions.
  - Because of how impactful headlines are – in a way that favors you or disfavors you –, I spent quite some time to come up with the best prompts I could think of to get the result and impact I wanted. Some words and phrases I included were: emotional, logical, impactful, convey the following meaning, achieve the following goal, as consize/short as possible, max of X characters/words/sentences.
- Add a last touch to my written text.
  - Because one of my goals was to improve my writing and thinking skills, I didn't want to sacrifice that for the sake of efficiency, so I wrote about 90% of the text on my own and used ChatGPT to "add a last touch" to it with the quote as my prompt and always with the addition of the command to "make it as consice and impactful as possible". I used the tool [Diffchecker](https://www.diffchecker.com/) to compare my original text with the revision from ChatGPT. It highlights the differences and makes comparing them very easy. I did the whole project with the free version of ChatGPT. If you spend $20 on the monthly subscription, you not only get access to unlimited access to the fastest AI models with the most advanced reasoning capabilities that gives you the best quality outputs possible, but you can also use one of the latest features called [Canvas](https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas/) which – at the time of this writing – is only available to paid subscription users. It's a new interface (way you interact with the system) that makes creating text and code and refining it way easier than the current chat interface. It saves you a lot of time by removing the need for constant copy pasting and external tools like Diffchecker. If you want to learn more about it check out the embedded link on the word "Canvas" above or check out this video for an indepth tutorial and use cases for it: [12 Use Cases for NEW ChatGPT Canvas! (Future of Writing)](https://youtu.be/LDVxv9UXQxg?si=W1elyKzMQFkrS733).

> [!NOTE]
> During the process of writing this paragraph I came to the realization that me not taking advantage of the described features makes no sense because of the insane return on investment. I just became a paid user and the only thing I feel bad about is not doing it sooner.

**🎯 RESULTS**

## 👨‍💻 Coding

> [_"Everybody should learn to program a computer ... because it teaches you how to think"_ – Steve Jobs](https://youtube.com/shorts/esvgwME4NyI?si=gaXUJDlGYpfXsM83)

**📗 METHODOLOGY**

Before starting to implement the code, it's important to take some time to create a plan. Just like in building architecture, a well-thought-out blueprint ensures that the foundation is solid, the structure is cohesive, and potential issues are anticipated before construction begins.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For all the non-tech people, the following paragraph will give you some perspective on how coding principles have the potential to benefit your business and your life in general.

Here are some examples of the top 50 current fortune 500 companies that are based on computer software or computer hardware, ranked by annual revenue: Amazon, State Grid Corporation of China (energy), Apple, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, Samsung Electronics, Bank of America, Bank of China. While it's clear that technology plays a significant role in the success of these businesses, I'm convinced that the real game-changer lies in the leadership's realization that the principles behind building technology can be effectively applied to every single aspect of business operations, like product and service development, human resources, leadership & management, sales, marketing etc. I can speak from personal experience, because I apply those principles to every single area in my life, from relationships, to career decisions, personal growth in regards to learning, philosophy and psychology, health management, and even day-to-day problem-solving.

> [!TIP]
> I take lessons and principles from every area of my life and apply them to each individual area of my life. Try that for some time and watch how much faster you'll move towards your goals...

The coding principles I used as blueprint for this project were the following:

**_1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)_**

- **What it means:**  
  Avoid duplicating code by abstracting repeated patterns into functions, modules, or classes.
- **Why it matters:**  
  Reduces redundancy (repetition), making the codebase easier to maintain by saving time and making it less prone to bugs when changes are required.
- **Real world example:**  
  Architects reuse standard blueprint elements for common building types (e.g., parking lots or bathrooms) to save time and reduce errors.

**_2. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)_**

- **What it means:**  
  Design systems and write code as simply as possible, avoiding overcomplication.
- **Why it matters:**  
  Simple code is easier to read, debug, and maintain. Complex code can lead to errors and increased technical debt which equals to more time spent. And _"time is money"_.
- **Real world example:**  
  A straight staircase is simpler to design, build, and install than a complicated spiral staircase, which often makes things harder without adding much benefit for most buildings.

**_3. SOLID (it's an acronym for a set of five principles of object-oriented programming)_**

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
  - **What it means:**  
    Each class or module should have one responsibility.
  - **Real world example:**  
    An architect designs, a plumber installs pipes, and an electrician wires the building. Each trade has a single responsibility, ensuring expertise and quality (for a lower price).
- **Open/Closed Principle**
  - **What it means:**  
    Code should be open to extension but closed to modification.
  - **Real world example:**  
    Adding a garage or an extra room to a house shouldn't require tearing down the entire house; the house could be built in a way that allows the existing design to be simply extended by a garage.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle**
  - **What it means:**  
    A new component should replace an old one without disrupting the system.
  - **Real world example:**  
    Doors are built to standard sizes so you can replace a wooden door with a glass one without altering the frame.
- **Interface Segregation Principle**
  - **What it means:**  
    Design small, specific interfaces/systems over large, general ones, so that components aren't burdened with unnecessary responsibilities.
  - **Real world example:**  
    Plumbing for water and gas lines are separate to prevent complications and ensure safety.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle**
  - **What it means:**  
    Depend on abstractions, not concretions.
  - **Real world example:**  
    The architect (high-level policy) defines requirements (abstraction) for materials (low-level modules e.g. fire-resistant walls, budget, delivery deadline etc.) without specifying brands. Contractors choose suitable materials.
- **Why the SOLID principles matter:**  
  They provide a foundation for building modular, flexible, reusable, maintainable, and scalable systems. These systems help you create things that are easy to understand, test, and modify over time, reducing the risk of costly errors or reworks.

**_4. Readability_**

- **What it means:**  
  Write code that is easy for humans to understand, even at the cost of extra comments or slightly longer code.
- **Why it matters:**  
  Code is read more often than written. Readable code facilitates collaboration and quicker debugging.
- **Real world example:**  
  Writing a step-by-step assembly guide for prefabricated components helps workers follow instructions with a much lower risk for mistakes that could turn out to be way more expensive than the extra time investment for the creation of the guide.

**_5. Modularity_**

- **What it means:**  
  Break down code into small, independent, and reusable modules or components.
- **Why it matters:**  
  Promotes code reuse, improves testing, and simplifies future updates or scaling.
- **Real world example:**  
  Using standardized, reusable components like bricks or panels enables flexibility and quick assembly or repair.

**_6. Performance Optimization_**

- **What it means:**  
  Strive for efficient solutions to reduce resource consumption.
- **Why it matters:**  
  Improves speed and scalability, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
- **Real world example:**  
  Using a crane to lift heavy things instead of relying on manual labor saves time, physical and mental effort.

**_7. Premature optimization is the root of all evil_**

- **What it means:**  
  Avoid spending excessive time on perfecting small details or features and ensure the overall structure and design are functional instead.
- **Why it matters:**  
  It wastes time, adds unnecessary complexity, and distracts from focusing on creating a clear, functional foundation, which should come first.
- **Real world example:**  
  Designing a highly complex roof before confirming the walls can support it risks wasting effort or needing redesigns.

**_8. YAGNI (Your Ain't Gonna Need It)_**

- **What it means:**  
  Only implement features and write code that are **strictly necessary** for the **current** requirements.
- **Why it matters:**  
  Avoids unnecessary complexity and wasted effort on features that may never be used.
- **Real world example:**  
  Building additional rooms "just in case" they're needed later usually leads to wasted ressources like time and materials.
